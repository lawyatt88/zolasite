The first page has links to the wedding site and user grid. However, the wedding site does * NOT * have any active links so you'll need to either go back to the root '/' or navigate manually by typing in the address bar: 
  -'/wedding' : Wedding Site
  -'/users' : User Grid


Note:
  I did my best to match the pdf, but wasn't sure if the style guide was the ultimate deciding factor with styling, or if I should try to make it look as close to the pdf as possible. I did a mix of both, erring on the side of what most closely resembled the PDF. So I hope it's pretty close to 'pixel perfect' even though I didn't use the exact pixel measurements from the pdf/style guide. It is responsive with regard to the two images provided, but as I only focused on those dimensions, I can't confidently say that it is fully responsive for other sizes.
